<h2>Am I a good pet?</h2>
  <p>Ball pythons are among the most popular pet snakes. They are good beginner snakes because they are docile and easy to care. Housing for a ball python can vary from simple to elaborate. The most important thing is that you follow several rules and check in on your pet often to ensure it appears to look and act healthy.</p>    
<h3>My care and feeding</h3>
<p>I like fresh or frozen mice. I enjoy hanging out on my branches in my terrarium</p>
